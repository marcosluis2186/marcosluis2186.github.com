The week between January 15th to January 21th, 2017 was a reveling time for myself. 
Every morning, when I wake up, my girlfriend prepares me a good cup of hot chocolate and I dedicate 
the first 30 minutes of my time to read [Brad Feld](https://twitter.com/bfeld) and
 [Jason Mendelson](https://twitter.com/jasonmendelson) [Venture Deals 3.0](http://venturedeals.com/) book.
 
Brad and Jason made an outstanding work with this book, explaining in simple terms the ins and outs of the **Venture Capital** industry, and how any entrepreneur could take advantage of it. This is not the review of the book like I promised to Brad, when he wrote about this new edition in his blog; this is just to talk about one of the side effects that the book has made in my mind.

So, Brad: Believe me, when I finish the book, I will write a detailed perspective of the book in this publication, including the little story how you sent me the book to Cuba without hesitation. Thanks again for this.

You should be wondering why I´m starting this post talking about Brad and Jason´s book, and how this is related to Apple.

Actually, it’s quite simple: One of the side effects of reading the book, it´s that it raises an inner interest I always have had inside my mind:

> To become in a long-term successful investor, with the capacity, resources and knowledge to build a modern investment portfolio a la “Bill Graham”
